  - Okay, now you're just showing off.
  - Damn you should've been a contruction worker
  - You into buildings shawty?
  - Did you bribe the physics engine?
  - That's high enough to... almost be impressive.
  - Are you... good at this?
  - Witchcraft! That's the only explanation.
  - You're making the other players look bad. Stop it.
  - All right, all right, settle down.
  - That was... unexpectedly competent.
  - I'm not mad, I'm just impressed.
  - You're almost at "needs-to-go-outside" levels.
