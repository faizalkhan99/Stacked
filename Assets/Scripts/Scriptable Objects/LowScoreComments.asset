  - Damn that sucks.
  - Did you try to miss?
  - 'Gravity: 1, You: 0.'
  - That wasn't a tower, that was a speedbump.
  - Are you just tapping randomly?
  - Wobble, wobble, thud. Classic.
  - My grandmother just beat this score. While asleep.
  - Don't quit your day job.
  - The ground looked lonely, I guess?
  - ...Was that a practice run?
  - '[silent, judgemental sigh]'
