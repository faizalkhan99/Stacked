  - Hey, not bad! For you.
  - You've officially graduated from "Total Disaster."
  - Look at you! You stacked some things.
  - That's... respectable. I guess.
  - A solid "meh" effort. Keep going!
  - Is that... a tower? Kinda!
  - Not terrible. I've seen worse.
  - This is fine. Everything is fine.
  - You're slightly above average! Maybe.
  - Well, look at Mr. Almost-Got-It.
