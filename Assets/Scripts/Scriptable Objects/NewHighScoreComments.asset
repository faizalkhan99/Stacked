  - NEW HIGH SCORE! Go tell your mom.
  - You broke it! The record, I mean.
  - We're gonna need a bigger camera.
  - Okay, you win. We get it.
  - Are you a wizard? Seriously.
  - That's... illegally high.
  - You're the new king of... blocks.
  - I guess we'll just rename the game after you.
  - You didn't just raise the bar, you launched it into orbit.
  - '[slow, impressed clap]'
